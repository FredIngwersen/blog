<p>I started programming my first year of high school in C++, then tried different languages and technologies, to figure out what I liked to work with. Having tried C++, Java, Python and Objective-C, I ended high school without really knowing what I wanted to do, except I knew et had to be related to computers and programming.</p>

<p>Right after high school I got a full-time internship at a company in Germany, which hosts an auction platform for the European gasmarket. The internship was 8 months and I primarily concerned myself with development of a regression testing framework for the company. This framework was created with Java and Selenium, and after its completion taught to the operational team, so they could use and expand on it, after my leave.</p>

<p>After my internship I went to The Technical University of Denmark as a Network Engineer. This, however was not my cup of tea, so currently I'm looking for a job, learning Assembly, and just applied for Computer Science on the University of Copenhagen.</p>
